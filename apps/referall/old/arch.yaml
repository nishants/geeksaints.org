Touch analysis :
  tried : click, touchstart, touchend and mousedown
  click:        slow, sluggish
  touchstart:   super sensitive(problem if screen is scrollable)
  touchend:     more responsive than click, equally scroll unfreindly as touchstart
  mousedown:    responsive(more than click), great with scroll.
  browser:      all events work on Chrome and Firefox(ios and android).

Testing:
  Qunit: supports sync and async tests.
    Qunit.test: "QUnit.test(name, testFunction)"
    Qunit.asyncTest: "QUnit.asyncTest(name, testFunction)"

Routing:
  OAuth2.0 : will redirect to pages with a state(or a parameter).
  Solution: use a single url fragment wiht url sage chars to decide what to render on screen.
  Format : param-name-1_param-value-1_param-name-2_param-value-2.

Controller: alias Page
  ResolvingViewData:
    ViewResolvesData: data call paralled to view creation
                    : view decides what to do if data fails(can callback controller if needed).


ActivePages: extension of the idea of active records to DOM
  HTML:     is a non relational data
  common:   DOM elements have behaviours in common(show, hide, destroy)
  elements: typical elements are container, form, input, image, text(span), multiline-text(p)
            list(select boxes)

Opinions:
  isType   : we can litter html a little to map elements to activepages model and actions
  ng-repeat: all repeated elements can be mapped to a type
              with common fields for
