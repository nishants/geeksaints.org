Touch analysis :
  tried : click, touchstart, touchend and mousedown
  click:        slow, sluggish
  touchstart:   super sensitive(problem if screen is scrollable)
  touchend:     more responsive than click, equally scroll unfreindly as touchstart
  mousedown:    responsive(more than click), great with scroll.
  browser:      all events work on Chrome and Firefox(ios and android).


Testing:
  Qunit: supports sync and async tests.
    Qunit.test: "QUnit.test(name, testFunction)"
    Qunit.asyncTest: "QUnit.asyncTest(name, testFunction)"
